# About

My name is Jim Mitchell. I've been blogging here since early 2004.

The site has gone through many style and platform changes since it launched way back then. In 2014, I "decluttered" all of the irrelevant content, leaving the posts which received the most traffic. I then chose to start over with a focus on writing about living a simpler, more meaningful life.

Less but better.

## History

Like a lot of other Mac users, I got my start as a design artist back in the early '90s.

My love affair for all things Apple began with a road-worn Mac SE/30. It was during those early years working with Aldus PageMaker, Macromedia Freehand and Adobe Photoshop that I learned the importance of keeping a computer system in tip-top shape.

This led me to create the simple Mac OS X utility Yasu in 2002, which is short for "Yet another system utility." Yasu became pretty popular for a while in the early 2000s. In 2017, I turned the app over to another developer, who in turn decided to let it die. I have pipe dreams of one day picking the project up again, but chances of that happening are slim to none at this point in my life.

## Today

Today, I work as a Sr. Business System Solution Architect at <a href="https://www.vizio.com">VIZIO</a> where I guide their Salesforce initiatives. Since this is my personal site, all thoughts and ideas expressed here are strictly my own and in no way reflect those of my employer.

I'm a Salesforce certified administrator, developer and consultant, and a certified Scrum Master. Other nerdy experience includes Microsoft SQL, MySQL, HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, and just enough Java to make me dangerous to my peers. I can even still get decent results out of Adobe Illustrator &amp; Photoshop when I need to.

I'm fortunate enough to have found and married an awesome woman that I'd be completely lost without and I have some pretty neat kids because of it. In my spare time, I like to write code, spend time with the family, play music, and enjoy anything that gets me outdoors on a hiking trail.

I enjoy hearing from readers, so if you'd like to ask a question, share something, or just chat in general, give me a holler on <a href="https://twitter.com/jimmitchell">Twitter</a>.

Thanks for visiting.
