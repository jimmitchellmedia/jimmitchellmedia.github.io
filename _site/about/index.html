				<h1 id="about">About</h1>

<p>My name is Jim Mitchell. I’ve been blogging here since early 2004.</p>

<p>The site has gone through many style and platform changes since it launched way back then. In 2014, I “decluttered” all of the irrelevant content, leaving the posts which received the most traffic. I then chose to start over with a focus on writing about living a simpler, more meaningful life.</p>

<p>Less but better.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Like a lot of other Mac users, I got my start as a design artist back in the early ’90s.</p>

<p>My love affair for all things Apple began with a road-worn Mac SE/30. It was during those early years working with Aldus PageMaker, Macromedia Freehand and Adobe Photoshop that I learned the importance of keeping a computer system in tip-top shape.</p>

<p>This led me to create the simple Mac OS X utility Yasu in 2002, which is short for “Yet another system utility.” Yasu became pretty popular for a while in the early 2000s. In 2017, I turned the app over to another developer, who in turn decided to let it die. I have pipe dreams of one day picking the project up again, but chances of that happening are slim to none at this point in my life.</p>

<h2 id="today">Today</h2>

<p>Today, I work as a Sr. Business System Solution Architect at <a href="https://www.vizio.com">VIZIO</a> where I guide their Salesforce initiatives. Since this is my personal site, all thoughts and ideas expressed here are strictly my own and in no way reflect those of my employer.</p>

<p>I’m a Salesforce certified administrator, developer and consultant, and a certified Scrum Master. Other nerdy experience includes Microsoft SQL, MySQL, HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, and just enough Java to make me dangerous to my peers. I can even still get decent results out of Adobe Illustrator &amp; Photoshop when I need to.</p>

<p>I’m fortunate enough to have found and married an awesome woman that I’d be completely lost without and I have some pretty neat kids because of it. In my spare time, I like to write code, spend time with the family, play music, and enjoy anything that gets me outdoors on a hiking trail.</p>

<p>I enjoy hearing from readers, so if you’d like to ask a question, share something, or just chat in general, give me a holler on <a href="https://twitter.com/jimmitchell">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for visiting.</p>
